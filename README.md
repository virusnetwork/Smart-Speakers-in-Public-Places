# Smart-Speakers-in-Public-Places
Master's Project for Miles Singleton

Research project for master's thesis. The purpose was to study how students would interact with voice interfaces in public places. Built a smart speaker system to advise which labs are free. Conducted a usability study, and planned out a field study but due to unforeseen events, an online survey would be used to gather qualitative and quantitive data. Research would show students had social anxiety about using such a system in public however usability study would show once a student had used such a system that anxiety had very much dissipated.
